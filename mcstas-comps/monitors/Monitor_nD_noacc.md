## Description

```text
This component is a general Monitor that can output 0/1/2D signals
It can produce many 1D signals (one for any variable specified in
option list), or a single 2D output (two variables correlation).
Also, an additional 'list' of neutron events can be produced.
By default, monitor is square (in x/y plane). A disk shape is also possible
The 'cylinder' and 'banana' option will change that for a banana shape
The 'sphere' option simulates spherical detector. The 'box' is a box.
The cylinder, sphere and banana should be centered on the scattering point.
The monitored flux may be per monitor unit area, and weighted by
a lambda/lambda(2200m/s) factor to obtain standard integrated capture flux.
In normal configuration, the Monitor_nD measures the current parameters
of the neutron that is beeing detected. But a PreMonitor_nD component can
be used in order to study correlations between a neutron being detected in
a Monitor_nD place, and given parameters that are monitored elsewhere
(at <b>PreMonitor_nD</b>).
The monitor can also act as a 3He gas detector, taking into account the
detection efficiency.

The 'bins' and 'limits' modifiers are to be used after each variable,
and 'auto','log' and 'abs' come before it. (eg: auto abs log hdiv bins=10
limits=[-5 5]) When placed after all variables,  these two latter modifiers
apply to the signal (e.g. intensity). Unknown keywords are ignored.
If no limits are specified for a given observable, reasonable defaults will be
applied. Note that these implicit limits are <b>even</b> applied in list mode.

<b>Implicit limits for typical variables:</b>
(consult monitor_nd-lib.c if you don't find your variable here)
x, y, z: Derived from detection-object geometry
k: [0 10] Angs-1
v: [0 1e6] m/s
t: [0 1] s
p: [0 FLT_MAX] in intensity-units
vx, vy: [-1000 1000] m/s
vz: [0 10000] m/s
kx, ky: [-1 1] Angs-1
kz: [-10 10] Angs-1
energy, omega: [0 100] meV
lambda,wavelength: [0 100] Angs
sx, sy, sz: [-1 1] in polarisation-units
angle: [-50 50] deg
divergence, vdiv, hdiv, xdiv, ydiv: [-5 5] deg

neutron: [0 simulaton_ncount]
id, pixel id: [0 FLT_MAX]
uservars u1,u2,u3: [-1e10 1e10]

In the case of multiple components at the same position, the 'parallel'
keyword must be used in each instance instead of defining a GROUP.

<b>EXAMPLES:</b>
<ul>
<li>MyMon = Monitor_nD(xwidth = 0.1, yheight = 0.1, zdepth = 0,
&emsp;&emsp;options = "intensity per cm2 angle,limits=[-5 5] bins=10,with
&emsp;&emsp;borders, file = mon1");
will monitor neutron angle from [z] axis, between -5
and 5 degrees, in 10 bins, into "mon1.A" output 1D file

<li> options = "sphere theta phi outgoing"
for a sphere PSD detector (out beam)  and saves into file "MyMon_[Date_ID].th_ph"

<li> options = "banana, theta limits=[10,130], bins=120, y"
a theta/height banana detector

<li> options = "angle radius all auto"
is a 2D monitor with automatic limits

<li> options = "list=1000 kx ky kz energy"
records 1000 neutron event in a file

<li> options = "multiple kx ky kz, auto abs log t, and list all neutrons"
makes 4 output 1D files and produces a complete list for all neutrons
and monitor log(abs(tof)) within automatic limits (for t)

<li> options = "theta y, sphere, pixel min=100"
a 4pi detector which outputs an event list with pixelID from the actual
detector surface, starting from index 100.

</ul>
To dynamically define a number of bins, or limits:
Use in DECLARE:    char op[256];
Use in INITIALIZE: sprintf(op, "lambda limits=[%g %g], bins=%i", lmin, lmax, lbin);
Use in TRACE:      Monitor_nD(... options=op ...)

<b>How to monitor any instrument/component variable into a Monitor_nD</b>
Suppose you want to monitor a variable 'age' which you assign somwhere in
the instrument:
COMPONENT MyMonitor = Monitor_nD(
xwidth = 0.1, yheight = 0.1,
user1="age", username1="Age of the Captain [years]",
options="user1, auto")
AT ...

See also the example in <a href="PreMonitor_nD.html">PreMonitor_nD</a> to
monitor neutron parameters cross-correlations.

%BUGS
The 'auto' option for guessing optimal variable bounds should NOT be used with MPI
as each process may use different limits.
