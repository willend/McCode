ESCRIPTION
A magnet with a spin-flip foil inside

This component models a magnet with a constant magnetic field and a slanted
magnetized foil inside acting as a spin-flipper. This arrangement may be used to
target the geometry of a Spin-Echo SANS instrument (Rekveldt, NIMB, 1997 || Rekveldt, Rev Sci Instr. 2005).
In its most basic form a SE-SANS instrument nrelies  on inclined field regions of
constant magnetic field, which can be difficult to realize. Instead it is possible to emulate
such regions using a magnetized foil.

In this component th emagntzied foil is modelled as a canted (by the angle phi) mathematical plane inside a region
of constant magnetic field of dimensions (xwidth,yheight,zdepth). Furthermore, exponetially decaying stray fields from
the constant field region may be specified by giving parameters (Bxwidth,Byheight,Bzdepth) > (xwidth,yheight,zdepth).
