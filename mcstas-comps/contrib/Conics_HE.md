# The `Conics_HE` Component

*McStas: Release: McStas 2.7
Date: September 2021

Hyperbolic-Elliptic shells for Wolter optic*

## Identification

- **Site:** 
- **Author:** Peter Wilendrup and Erik Knudsen <br>(derived from Giacomo Resta skeleton-component)
- **Origin:** DTU
- **Date:** September 2021

## Description

```text
Implements a set of nshells Wolter Ellipsoid/Hyperboloid pairs using conics.h from ConicTracer.

The component has two distinct modes of specifying the geometry:
a) Via the radii vector, parametrized from largest to smallest radius with a length of 'nshells'

b) By specifying radii rmax and rmin, between which a quadratic law distributes 'nshells' surfaces.

The mirrors are assumed to be touching at the mid-optic plane, i.e. there is no gap between primary
and secondary mirror.
By definition the ratio between primary and secondary mirror glancing angles is 1/3.
At present a single m-value is used for all mirrors.
```

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.
