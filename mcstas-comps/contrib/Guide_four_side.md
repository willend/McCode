## Description

```text
This component models a guide with four side walls.
As user you can controll the properties of every wall separatly. All togther you have up to
8 walls: 4 inner walls and 4 outer walls.

Every single wall can have a elliptic, parabolic or straight shape.
All four sides of the guide are independent from each other.
In the elliptic case the side wall shape follows the equation x^2/b^2+(z+z0)^2/a^2=1
(the center of the ellipse is located at (0,-z0)).
In the parabolic case the side wall shape follows the equation z=b-ax^2;mc
In the straight case the side wall shape follows the equation z=l/(w2-w1)*x-w1.

The shape selection is done by the focal points. The focal points are located at the
z-axis and are defined by their distance to the entrance or exit window of the guide
(in the following called 'focal length').

If both focal lengths for one wall are zero it will be a straight wall (entrance and
exit width have to be given in the beginning).

If one of the focal lengths is not zero the shape will be parabolic (only the entrance width
given in the beginning is recognized; exit width will be calculated). If the the entrance
focal length is zero the guide will be a focusing devise.
If the exit focal length is zero it will be defocusing devise.

If both focals are non zero the shape of the wall will be elliptic (only the entrance width
given in the beginning is recognized; exit width will be calculated).

Notice: 1.)The focal points are in general located outside the guide (positive focal lengths).
Focal points inside the guide need to have negative focal lengths.
2.)The exit width parameters (w2r, w2l, h2u,h2d) are only taken into account if the
walls have a linear shape. In the ellitic or parabolic case they will be ignored.

For the inner channel: the outer side of each wall is calculated by the component in depentence
of the wallthickness and the shape of the inner side.

Each of walls can have a own indepenting reflecting layer (defined by an input file)
or it can be a absorber or it can be transparent.

The reflectivity properties can be given by an input file (Format [q(Angs-1) R(0-1)]) or by
parameters (Qc, alpha, m, W).

%BUGS
This component does not work with gravitation on.

This component does not work correctly in GROUP-modus.
