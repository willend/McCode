# MCViNE sample kernels in McStas

This note documents the McStas components ported from the sample scattering kernels of MCViNE (https://github.com/mcvine/mcvine, mccomponents/lib/kernels/sample, and the SANS2D_ongrid kernel of https://github.com/mcvine/acc).

Each kernel comes in two forms that run the same kernel code (`share/mcvine-lib.c`):

- **Union process** `contrib/MCViNE_<kernel>_process.comp`: geometry, containers, absorption and multiple scattering are handled by Union (`Union_make_material`, `Union_box/cylinder/sphere/mesh`, `Union_master`).
- **Standalone sample** `contrib/MCViNE_<kernel>.comp`: a box, (hollow) cylinder or sphere with its own ray tracing (MCViNE's HomogeneousNeutronScatterer).

Test instruments: `examples/Tests_samples/Test_MCViNE_<kernel>/`. Each runs the same sample either as the Union process (`comp_select=1`) or as the standalone component (`comp_select=2`), so the two `%Example` values can be compared directly. Test data is in `data/MCViNE/`.

## 3. Using the Union processes

```
COMPONENT phon = MCViNE_Phonon_CoherentInelastic_SingleXtal_process(
    idf_dir="MCViNE/fcc_toy_phonons", atoms="MCViNE/fcc_toy_atoms.dat", T=300)
  AT (0,0,0) ABSOLUTE ROTATED (0, 30, 0) ABSOLUTE     // crystal orientation
COMPONENT mat  = Union_make_material(my_absorption=1.39, process_string="phon") AT (0,0,0) ABSOLUTE
COMPONENT samp = Union_box(xwidth=0.01, yheight=0.01, zdepth=0.01, priority=1, material_string="mat") AT (0,0,5) ABSOLUTE
COMPONENT master = Union_master() AT (0,0,5) ABSOLUTE
```

- **Absorption** is a material property: `Union_make_material(my_absorption=...)` (inverse penetration depth at 2200 m/s). The coherent phonon processes print the value implied by their atoms file.
- **Parameters:** processes take `packing_factor` and `interact_fraction` like the other Union processes, and `scattering_coefficient` [1/m] or `sigma_scat` [barn] with `Vc` [Å³] (phonon kernels: `sigma_inc` and `Vc`, or the atoms file).
- **Orientation:** the anisotropic kernels (ConstantvQE, E_vQ, SvQ, SANS2D_ongrid, CoherentInelastic_SingleXtal) follow the ROTATED placement of the process component, as `Single_crystal_process` does.
- **DGSSXRes** aims with the Union focusing of the geometry (`target_index` or `target_x/y/z`, and `focus_r`, `focus_xw/focus_xh` or `focus_aw/focus_ah`). The other kernels sample their own final directions, as in MCViNE.

### Implementation note on the Union core

Union selects the physics functions with a `switch` on `enum process` (no function pointers, for GPU builds). One new entry, `MCViNE`, is added. Its storage struct carries a pointer to the kernel and to its sampling function, so further MCViNE kernels can be added without touching the Union core again. The change adds 12 lines (`share/union-lib.c`: enum entry and union member; `share/union-suffix.c`: two `case MCViNE:` blocks guarded by `PROCESS_MCVINE_DETECTOR`) and does not affect existing processes.

## 4. Standalone components: transport, expressions and data formats

- **Geometry:** box (`xwidth,yheight,zdepth`), cylinder (`radius,yheight`), hollow cylinder (+`thickness`), or sphere (`radius`). Q vectors, targets, reciprocal vectors and atom positions are in the component frame; rotate the component to orient a crystal.
- **Cross sections:** `absorption_coefficient` (at 2200 m/s) and `scattering_coefficient` in 1/m, as in MCViNE, or `sigma_abs`, `sigma_scat` [barn] with `Vc` [Å³].
- **Transport:** forced scattering at a uniformly chosen depth, weighted by `L·exp(-(μ+σ)x)·σ` and the exit attenuation, exactly like MCViNE's `interact_path1`. `p_transmit` keeps a fraction as attenuated direct beam, `order>1` adds further (analog) scatterings, and `pack` scales μ and σ.

### Expressions

`E_Q`, `S_Q`, `sigma_Q`, `gamma_Q`, `SQ`, `SvQ` and `SQE` are strings evaluated at run time, like MCViNE's fparser. The supported syntax is:
- operators `+ - * / ^ ** %`, comparisons, `&& ||`
- `if(c,a,b)`
- functions `sin cos tan asin acos atan sinh cosh tanh exp log log10 log2 sqrt abs floor ceil int sign cbrt pow atan2 min max hypot fmod`
- constants `pi`, `e`

The variables are `Q` (Å⁻¹), `E` (meV), and `Qx Qy Qz`.

### Data formats

- **S(Q) table:** two columns, Q and S.
- **S(Q,E) grid:** the `Isotropic_Sqw` layout: a row of q values, a row of ω values, then nq rows of nω values.
- **S(**Q**) grid:** three rows of `min max n`, then nx·ny·nz values with Qx slowest.
- **SANS2D map:** a row of Qx, a row of Qy, then ny rows of nx values.
- **DOS:** two ASCII columns, E [meV] and g. A `#...THz` comment switches the energy unit to THz. The MCViNE IDF binary `DOS` file is also read.
- **Phonons:** an MCViNE IDF directory containing `Qgridinfo`, `Omega2`, `Polarizations` and optionally `DOS`, e.g. from phonopy through MCViNE's tools. It needs an atoms file with columns `x y z [Å] mass [amu] b_coh [fm] σ_inc σ_abs [barn]`, in the same atom order as the IDF files.


## 5. Where the port differs from MCViNE

1. **Kinematically forbidden events are absorbed.** In MCViNE, the neutron carries on unchanged but keeps the scattering weight.
2. **Grids are interpolated.** Grids are point values with linear, bilinear or trilinear interpolation, and give 0 outside the grid. MCViNE's `Grid*` functors use nearest-bin lookup and throw an error out of range.
3. **Three MCViNE sampling loops are biased, and each has an `unbiased=1` switch.** The default (`unbiased=0`) reproduces MCViNE:
   - **E_Q:** retries and divides the weight by the number of attempts, which is about +1.7 % in the test below.
   - **Broadened / Lorentzian E_Q:** retry without an acceptance correction.
   - **CoherentInelastic_SingleXtal:** retries directions until a root exists. The error was small in the tests.
   - **CoherentInelastic_PolyXtal:** uses an empirical accessible-volume formula, which comes out about +8 % in the tests.
4. **PolyXtal ×2 factor:** the factor for "two choices of E_f" now tests Ei against the phonon energy. MCViNE tests it against the signed energy transfer, which doubles the weight even when only annihilation is possible.
5. **SANS2D_ongrid:** the port uses vz = √(vi² − vx² − vy²). mcvine/acc has `vx²·vy²` there, which is a bug.
6. **b_coh** is read with its sign from the atoms file. MCViNE derives |b| from σ_coh using `periodictable`.
7. **Multiple scattering:** MCViNE splits each event into transmitted, absorbed and scattered copies (`mcweights`, default 1:1:1). McStas can't split events, so the absorbed branch is folded into the weight and further scatterings are sampled analogically. The expected values are the same.


## 6. Validation

Scripts (attached to the pull request) built dedicated test instruments and compare the ports against analytic integrals, McStas's own components, or independent Python calculations. Ratios are relative to McStas `Incoherent` with the same σ, and ± is the Monte Carlo statistical error.

### Union processes vs standalone components

A second set compared each process with its standalone component. Both use the same cylinder (r=5 mm, h=10 mm) and absorption, with full multiple scattering: Union_master on one side and `order=20` on the other. The table shows the scattered intensity ratio and the weighted mean E and |Q| of the scattered neutrons.

| Kernel | I_union / I_standalone | ⟨E⟩ standalone / Union (meV) | ⟨\|Q\|⟩ standalone / Union (Å⁻¹) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ConstantEnergyTransfer | 1.003 ± 0.004 | 15.71 / 15.72 | 6.714 / 6.707 |
| ConstantQE | 0.999 ± 0.004 | 15.76 / 15.77 | 4.045 / 4.045 |
| ConstantvQE | 0.999 ± 0.008 | 33.72 / 33.72 | 2.291 / 2.291 |
| E_Q | 0.998 ± 0.009 | 11.07 / 11.02 | 6.698 / 6.673 |
| Broadened_E_Q | 1.000 ± 0.009 | 11.06 / 11.13 | 6.693 / 6.708 |
| LorentzianBroadened_E_Q | 1.000 ± 0.008 | 10.33 / 10.30 | 6.671 / 6.676 |
| E_vQ | 0.979 ± 0.027 | 34.74 / 35.06 | 6.108 / 6.091 |
| SQ | 1.000 ± 0.005 | 0 / 0 | 7.127 / 7.131 |
| SvQ | 1.001 ± 0.004 | 0 / 0 | 7.153 / 7.157 |
| SQE (grid) | 0.964 ± 0.037 | 11.86 / 11.48 | 3.923 / 3.889 |
| SANS2D_ongrid | 0.996 ± 0.007 | 0 / 0 | 0.123 / 0.123 |
| Phonon_IncoherentElastic | 0.995 ± 0.009 | 0 / 0 | 6.366 / 6.378 |
| Phonon_IncoherentInelastic | 0.995 ± 0.004 | 1.77 / 1.75 | 8.250 / 8.246 |
| Phonon_CoherentInelastic_PolyXtal | 0.995 ± 0.022 | 3.53 / 3.41 | 7.943 / 7.893 |
| Phonon_CoherentInelastic_SingleXtal | 1.023 ± 0.102 | 3.19 / 2.80 | 7.920 / 8.011 |

With the process rotated 30° about y, ConstantvQE gives 1.003 ± 0.006 and the same mean final velocity vector to 0.1 m/s. SvQ and SingleXtal agree within their (large) errors. DGSSXRes with Union geometry focusing gives 1.003 ± 0.006, with the same mean final velocity as the standalone target.

McStas `Incoherent` disagrees for two cases. For a hollow cylinder, its hole has closed ends. With `order=2` it overshoots the analog-MC value, so it can't be used as the reference there.

The phonon test data is a toy fcc nearest-neighbour Born–von Kármán model, not real Al. `data/MCViNE/make_fcc_toy_phonons.py` regenerates it.
