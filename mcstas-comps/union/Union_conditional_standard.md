# The `Union_conditional_standard` Component

*McStas: A conditional component that filter on basic variables of exit state*

## Identification

- **Author:** Mads Bertelsen
- **Origin:** University of Copenhagen

## Description

```text
Part of the Union components, a set of components that work together and thus
sperates geometry and physics within McStas.
The use of this component requires other components to be used.

1) One specifies a number of processes using process components
2) These are gathered into material definitions using Union_make_material
3) Geometries are placed using Union_box / Union_cylinder, assigned a material
4) A Union_master component placed after all of the above

Only in step 4 will any simulation happen, and per default all geometries
defined before this master, but after the previous will be simulated here.

There is a dedicated manual available for the Union_components

This is a conditional component that affects the loggers in the target_loggers
string. When a logger is affected, it will only record events if the
conditional is true at the end of the simulation of a ray in the master.
Conditionals can be used to for example limit the loggers to rays that end
within a certain energy range, time interval or similar.

One can apply several conditionals to each logger if desired.

In the extend section of a master, the tagging conditional can be acsessed by
the variable name tagging_conditional_extend. Beware, that it only works as
long as the tagging system is active, so you may want to increase the number
of histories allowed by that master component before stopping.

overwrite_logger_weight can be used to force the loggers this conditional
controls to write the final weight for each scattering event, instead of the
recorded value.
