## Description

```text
Part of the Union components, a set of components that work together and thus
separates geometry and physics within McStas.
The use of this component requires other components to be used.

1) One specifies a number of processes using process components
2) These are gathered into material definitions using Union_make_material
3) Geometries are placed using Union_box/cylinder/sphere, assigned a material
4) Logger and conditional components can be placed which will record what happens
5) A Union_master component placed after all of the above

Only in step 5 will any simulation happen, and per default all geometries
defined before this master, but after the previous will be simulated here.

There is a dedicated manual available for the Union_components

This component is an absorption logger, and thus placed in point 4) above.

A absorption logger will log something for each absorption event happening
in the geometry or geometries on which it is attached. These are specified
in the target_geometry string. By leaving it blank, all geometries are
logged, even the ones not defined at this point in the instrument file.
Multiple geometries are specified as a comma separated list.

This absorption logger records the absorbed intensity as a function of the
measured and true wavelength. The measured wavelength is calculated from
the time of flight and distance travelled. This distance is a constant from
source to sample added to the distance from the sample position to the
detector pixel in which the event is detected. The true wavelength is
calculated directly from the velocity. This information shows any error in
conversion from tof to wavelength, especially from any added travelled
distance from multiple scattering.

The lambda_min, max and bin parameters are used to set both the range for
measured and true wavelength. If either of these, denoted lambda_m and
lambda_t respectively, is set they will overwrite the lambda setting for
that part. Sine most data will be along the line lambda_m = lambda_t, it
is possible to record lambda_m / lambda_t as a function of lambda_t, which
will be close to 1.0. This mode is selected by setting relative_measured
to 1, and then the range can be selected with relative_min, max and bins.

This absorption logger needs to be placed in space, the position is recorded in
the coordinate system of the logger component. Note the detection is along the
y axis of the component, so it is natural to place it relative to a cylinder.

This component works as other absorption loggers, but converts the tof and
position data to wavelength, which is then compared to the actual wavelength
calculated from the neutron state. The neutron position used to calculate
the wavelength is pixelated while the time of flight is continous. The
distance from source to sample is an input parameter, and the distance from
sample to a detector pixel is calculated using the reference component position
which should be specified with a relative component index.

It is possible to attach one or more conditional components to this absorption
logger. Such a conditional component would impose a condition on the state of
the neutron after the Union_master component that executes the simulation,
and the absorption logger will only record the event if this condition is true.

To use the logger_conditional_extend function, set it to some integer value n
and make and extend section to the master component that runs the geometry.
In this extend function, logger_conditional_extend[n] is 1 if the conditional
stack evaluated to true, 0 if not. This way one can check what rays is logged
using regular McStas monitors. Only works if a conditional is applied to this
logger.
