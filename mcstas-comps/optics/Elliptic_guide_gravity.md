# The `Elliptic_guide_gravity` Component

*McStas: Perfect elliptic guide which allow for simulations with gravity.
The guide mirrors can be divided into segments with individual m-values.
Parabolic guide components can also be simulated.*

## Description

```text
The perfect elliptic guide is centered along the z-axis with the entrance
and exit in the xy-plane. The horizontal and vertical ellipses defining
the guide geometry is by default set by two focal points.
These are placed a distance away from the guide openings along the z-axis;
if distance given is positive, when the focal point is outside the guide.

Multiple options for defining these ellipse exist including approximation of
parabolas and half ellipses (mid point of the ellipse or one of the guide openings)

The guide coating parameters can be set for each side of the guide.
Furthermore the m-value can be specified for user defined segments
of the guide.

<b>Example 1, Elliptical definition using focal points:</b>

Elliptic_guide_gravity(
l=50,
linxw=5,linyh=5,loutxw=10,loutyh=10,
xwidth=0.05,yheight=0.05,
R0=0.99,Qc=0.0219,alpha=6.07,m=1.0,W=0.003
)

<b>Example 2: Half elliptical definition:</b>

Elliptic_guide_gravity(
l=50,
linxw=5,linyh=5,loutxw=10,loutyh=10,
xwidth=0.1,yheight=0.1,
R0=0.99,Qc=0.0219,alpha=6.07,m=1.0,W=0.003,
option = "halfEllipse",
dimensionsAt = "entrance"
)

<b>Example 3: Parabolic approximation:</b>

Elliptic_guide_gravity(
l=50,
linxw=5,linyh=5,loutxw=1e6,loutyh=1e6, // values larger than 1e8 may cause erroneous results
xwidth=0.1,yheight=0.1,
R0 = 0.99,Qc=0.0219,alpha=6.07,m=1.0,W=0.003,
dimensionsAt = "exit"
)

<b>Example 4: Elliptical definition with varying m-values:</b>

Elliptic_guide_gravity(
l=50,
linxw=5,linyh=5,loutxw=10,loutyh=10,
xwidth=0.1,yheight=0.1,
R0 = 0.99,Qc=0.0219,alpha=6.07,m=1.0,W=0.003,
mvaluesright=marray,mvaluesleft=marray,mvaluestop=marray,mvaluesbottom=marray
)

where marray is initialized as
for(iter=0; iter < 50; iter++){ marray[iter] = 2; }
And Declared as
double mValues[50];
If you are using the array-based coating-specification, you **must** give nSegments a compatible value.
```
