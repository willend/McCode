## Description

```text
Models a rectangular straight guide tube centered on the Z axis, with
gravitation handling. The entrance lies in the X-Y plane.
The guide can be channeled (nslit,d,nhslit parameters). The guide coating
specifications may be entered via different ways (global, or for
each wall m-value).

Waviness (random) may be specified either globally or for each mirror type.
Side chamfers (due to substrate processing) may be specified the same way.
In order to model a realistic straight guide assembly, a long guide of
length 'l' may be splitted into 'nelements' between which chamfers/gaps are
positioned.

The reflectivity may be specified either using an analytical mode (see
Component manual) or as a text file in free format, with 1st
column as q[Angs-1] and 2nd column as the reflectivity R in [0-1].
For details on the geometry calculation see the description in the McStas
component manual.

There is a special rotating mode in order to approximate a Fermi Chopper
behaviour, in the case the neutron trajectory is nearly linear inside the
chopper slits, i.e. the neutrons are fast w/r/ to the chopper speed.
Slits are straight, but may be super-mirror coated. In this case, the
component is NOT centered, but located at its entry window. It should then
be shifted by -l/2.

Example: Guide_gravity(w1=0.1, h1=0.1, w2=0.1, h2=0.1, l=12,
R0=0.99, Qc=0.0219, alpha=6.07, m=1.0, W=0.003)
