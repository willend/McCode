## Description

```text
Models a curved neutron guide with cylindrical walls.

Bender radius, entrance width and height are necessary input data. To define
the bender, you may either enter the deviation angle 'Win' or the length 'l'.
The bender may consist of 'k' vertical channels, separated by partitioning walls
of thickness 'd'. Three different reflectivity profiles can be given: for outer
walls, for inner walls and for the top and bottom walls. The partitioning walls
have the same coating as the exterior walls.

The entrance lies in the X-Y plane, centered on the Z axis. The neutrons will
also leave the bender in the X-Y plane at the z-value l=r*Win, i.e. they are
centred on (0,0,r*Win); they have an (average) flight direction along the z-axis.
Therefore, the following component is adjacent, if positioned AT (0,0,r*Win)
<b>without</b> rotation.
So, seen from outside, it behaves like a straight guide along the Z axis. As a
consequence, it is shown straight in 'mcdisplay'.
This behaviour results from a co-ordinate transformation inside the component.
It is done to facilitate its use. Neither rotation nor shift along the x-axis
need to be calculated; a new arm is not necessary. Internally, the bender is
bent to the negative X axis;

Example:
Bender of 120 mm height, 50 mm width, 250 m radius and 0.04 rad (or 2.292 deg) curvature
not channeled, with a standard m=2 coating on

Bender(w=0.05,h=0.12,r=250,Win=0.04,
R0a=0.99,Qca=0.021,alphaa=6.07,ma=2,Wa=0.003,
R0i=0.99,Qci=0.021,alphai=6.07,mi=2,Wi=0.003,
R0s=0.99,Qcs=0.021,alphas=6.07,ms=2,Ws=0.003)

%BUGS
Some users have reported potentially strange behaviours with this component.
This component does not work with gravitation on.
