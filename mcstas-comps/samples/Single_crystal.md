## Description

```text
Single crystal with mosaic. Delta-D/D option for finite-size effects.
Rectangular geometry. Multiple scattering and secondary extinction included.
The mosaic may EITHER be specified isotropic by setting the mosaic input
parameter, OR anisotropic by setting the mosaic_a, mosaic_b, and mosaic_c
parameters.
The crystal lattice can be bent locally, keeping the external geometry unchanged.
Curvature is spherical along vertical and horizontal axes.

<b>Speed/stat optimisation using SPLIT</b>
In order to dramatically improve the simulation efficiency, we recommend to
use a SPLIT keyword on this component (or prior to it), as well as to disable
the multiple scattering handling by setting order=1. This is especially powerful
for large reflection lists such as with macromolecular proteins. When an incoming
particle is identical to the preceeding, reciprocal space initialisation is
skipped, and a Monte Carlo choice is done on available reflections from the last
repciprocal space calculation! To assist the user in choosing a "relevant" value
of the SPLIT, a rolling average of the number of available reflections is
calculated and presented in the component output.

<b>Mosacitiy modes:</b>
The component features three independent ways of parametrising mosaicity:
a) The original algorithm where mosaicity is implemented by extending each
reflection by a Gaussian "cigar" in reciprocal space, characterised by
the parameters mosaic and delta_d_d.
(Also known as "isotropic mosaicity".)
b) A similar mode where mosaicities can be non-isotropic and given as the
parameters mosaic_a, mosaic_b and mosaic_c, around the unit cell axes.
(Also known as "anisotropic mosaicity".)
c) Given two "macroscopically"/experimentally measured width/mosaicities
of two independent reflections, parametrised by the list
mosaic_AB = {mos_a, mos_b, a_h, a_k, a_l, b_h, b_k, b_l}, a set of
microscopic mosaicities as in b) are estimated (internally) and applied.
(Also known as "phenomenological mosaicity".)

<b>Powder- and PG-mode</b>
When these two modes are used (powder=1 or PG=1), a randomised transformation
of the particle direction is made before and after scattering, thereby letting
the single crystal behave as a crystallite of either a powder (crystallite
orientation fully randomised) or pyrolytic graphite (crystallite randomised around
the c-axis).

<b>Curved crystal mode</b>
The component features a method to curve the lattice planes slightly with respect
to the outer geometry of the crystal. The method is implemented as a transformation
on the particle direction vector, and should be used only in cases where
a) The reflection lattice vector is ~ orthogonal to the crystal surface
b) The modelled curvarture is "small" with respect to the crystal surface

<b>Sample shape:</b>
Sample shape may be a cylinder, a sphere, a box or any other shape
box/plate:       xwidth x yheight x zdepth
cylinder:        radius x yheight
sphere:          radius (yheight=0)
any shape:       geometry=OFF file

The complex geometry option handles any closed non-convex polyhedra.
It computes the intersection points of the neutron ray with the object
transparently, so that it can be used like a regular sample object.
It supports the PLY, OFF and NOFF file format but not COFF (colored faces).
Such files may be generated from XYZ data using:
qhull < coordinates.xyz Qx Qv Tv o > geomview.off
or
powercrust coordinates.xyz
and viewed with geomview or java -jar jroff.jar (see below).
The default size of the object depends on the OFF file data, but its
bounding box may be resized using xwidth,yheight and zdepth.

<b>Crystal definition file format</b>
Crystal structure is specified with an ascii data file. Each line contains
4 or more numbers, separated by white spaces:

h k l ... F2

The first three numbers are the (h,k,l) indices of the reciprocal lattice
point, and the 7-th number is the value of the structure factor |F|**2, in
barns. The rest of the numbers are not used; the file is in the format
output by the Crystallographica program.
The reflection list should be ordered by decreasing d-spacing values.
Lines begining by '#' are read as comments (ignored). Most sample parameters
may be defined from the data file header, following the same mechanism as
PowderN.

Current data file header keywords include, for data format specification:
#column_h <index of the Bragg Qh column>
#column_k <index of the Bragg Qk column>
#column_l <index of the Bragg Ql column>
#column_F2 <index of the squared str. factor '|F|^2' column [b]>
#column_F  <index of the structure factor norm '|F|' column>
and for material specification:
#sigma_abs <value of absorption cross section [barns]>
#sigma_inc <value of incoherent cross section [barns]>
#Delta_d/d <value of Detla_d/d width for all lines>
#lattice_a <value of the a lattice parameter [Angs]>
#lattice_b <value of the b lattice parameter [Angs]>
#lattice_c <value of the c lattice parameter [Angs]>
#lattice_aa <value of the alpha lattice angle [deg]>
#lattice_bb <value of the beta  lattice angle [deg]>
#lattice_cc <value of the gamma lattice angle [deg]>

Last, CIF, FullProf and ShelX files can be read, and converted to F2(hkl) lists
if 'cif2hkl' is installed. The CIF2HKL env variable can be used to point to a
proper executable, else the McCode, then the system installed versions are used.

See the Component Manual for more defails.

Example: Single_crystal(xwidth=0.01, yheight=0.01, zdepth=0.01, mosaic = 5, reflections="YBaCuO.lau")

A PG graphite crystal plate, cut for (002) reflections
Single_crystal(xwidth = 0.002, yheight = 0.1, zdepth = 0.1,
mosaic = 30, reflections = "C_graphite.lau",
ax=0,      ay=2.14,   az=-1.24,
bx = 0,    by = 0,    bz =  2.47,
cx = 6.71, cy = 0,    cz =  0)

A leucine protein, without multiple scattering
Single_crystal(xwidth=0.005, yheight=0.005, zdepth=0.005,
mosaic = 5, reflections="leucine.lau", order=1)

A Vanadium incoherent elastic scattering with multiple scattering
Single_crystal(xwidth=0.01, yheight=0.01, zdepth=0.01,
reflections="", sigma_abs=5.08, sigma_inc=4.935,
ax=3.0282, by=3.0282, cz=3.0282/2)

Also, always use a non-zero value of delta_d_d.

%VALIDATION:
This component has been validated.

This sample component can advantageously benefit from the SPLIT feature, e.g.
SPLIT COMPONENT sx = Single_crystal(...)
