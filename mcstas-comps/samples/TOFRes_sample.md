## Description

```text
An inelastic sample with completely uniform scattering in both solid angle
and energy. This sample is used together with the TOFRes_monitor component
and (optionally) the mcresplot front-end to compute the resolution
function of all time-of-flight instruments.
The method of time focusing is used to optimize the simulations.

The shape of the sample is either:
1. Hollow cylinder (Please note that the cylinder **must** be specified with both
a radius and a wall-thickness!)
2. A massive, rectangular box specified with dimensions xwidth, yheight, zdepth.
(i.e. **withouht** a thickness)

hollow cylinder shape **must** be specified with both a radius and a wall-thickness.
The box is

The scattered neutrons will have directions towards a given target and
detector arrival time in an interval of time_width centered on time_bin.
This target area is default disk shaped, but may also be rectangular
if specified focus_xw and focus_yh
or focus_aw and focus_ah, respectively in meters and degrees.
The target itself is either situated according to given coordinates (x,y,z),
or setting the relative target_index of the component to focus at
(next is +1). This target position will be set to its AT position.
When targeting to centered components, such as spheres or cylinders,
define an Arm component where to focus at.

Example: TOFRes_sample(thickness=0.001, radius=0.01, yheight=0.04, focus_xw=0.025, focus_yh=0.025, time_bin=3e4, time_width=200, target_x=0, target_y=0, target_z=1)
```
