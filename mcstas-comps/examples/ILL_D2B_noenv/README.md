## Description

```text
The diffractometer D2B is characterised by the very high take-off angle (135 deg)
for the monochromator, which has a relatively large mosaic spread of 20' to
compensate for the corresponding intensity (dl/l) loss. It is 300 mm high,
focusing vertically onto about 50 mm; this large incident vertical divergence
is matched by 200 mm high detectors and collimators. A complete diffraction
pattern is obtained after about 100 steps of 0.025 deg in 2theta, since the 64
detectors are spaced at 2.5 deg intervals. Such scans take typically 30 minutes;
they are repeated to improve statistics.

D2B was designed for work on samples and high resolution of very large
d-spacings using wavelengths of between 2.4 Å and 6 Å. Wavelengths can easily be
changed under computer control, since they are all obtained by a simple rotation
within the Ge[hhl] plane. A large graphite filter can be switched in to provide
a very clean beam at 2.4 Angs, and a cold Be-filter can be used for longer
wavelengths.

This model implements as well the Caglioti UVW equations, that give estimates
of the instrument resolution.
