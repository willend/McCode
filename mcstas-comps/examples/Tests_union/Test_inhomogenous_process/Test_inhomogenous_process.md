# Test instrument for the Inhomogenous_incoherent component

### Author: Daniel Lomholt Christensen @NBI

This instrument is a test for the Inhomogenous incoherent process component, that works with the McStas Union system.


Below I have tested the implementation in three important setups. For each setup, I use three different approaches.
First I build the union materials with the Incoherent_process component (and here 10 Union_boxes are used).
Secondly I build the union materials with the Inhomogenous_incoherent_process (here using only 1 component, but setting the number of sampling points to 10).
Thirdly I build a material that uses both the Inhomogenous_incoherent and incoherent processes, to perform the same action.


The first two setups, I have a detector placed on the side of a sample, with 10 different boxes that follow each other.
For the first experiment, the boxes have the same scattering cross section.
For the second experiment, the boxes vary according to a linear rise in scattering cross section.
For a visualization of these setups, see the below figure,

And the results of the first experiment is,

While the results of the second experiment is,

For the last setup, the detector is placed in a transmission geometry, with the 10 boxes rotated 90 degrees.
This means that they vary their scattering cross section linearly across x in the mcstas coordinate system.
The result of this is,

Another experiment is performed, just to check that adding a directional process, such as the PhononSimple_process does not break the system.
This material is created with the linearly rising scattering cross section, implemented with the Inhomogenous process, as well as a PhononSimple_process.
