- **Author:** Genoveva Burca (Genoveva.Burca@stfc.ac.uk)
- **Origin:** ISIS
- **Date:** October 2017

## Description

```text
McStas instrument for simulating the IMAT - imaging and diffraction
New McStas moderator file (G. Skoro, ISIS Facility) was added
\\ISIS\Shares\NeutronicsTeam\TS-2\HydroMod_Upgrade\McStas_TS2_HydroMod_Base_newVirtMod_350mm\Let_Base.mcstas
Components positions were extracted from IMAT final design (March 2016)
Choppers were not added to this model
Diffraction detectors are
