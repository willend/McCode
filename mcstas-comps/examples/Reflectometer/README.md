# The `Reflectometer` Instrument

*McStas: Simple reflectometer with two slits, a sample (either none, mirror or multilayer),
and a detector. For use in the OMIC summer school 2012.*

## Description

```text
This simple reflectometer consists of a source (using the standard PSI parameters
for three Maxwellian distributions), on which the user can control the bandwidth
by simply choosing a minumum and maximum value. Two slits handle the divergence
distribution on the sample. The sample itself can either be an empty spot, a simple
mirror, or a multilayer. A simple PSD detector is used for detecting the scattered
beam. The scattering is in the horizontal plane.
