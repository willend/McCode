## Description

D11 - LOWEST MOMENTUM TRANSFER and  LOWEST BACKGROUND SANS

D11 is the archetype of a long, pinhole geometry instrument for small angle
neutron scattering (SANS), designed for the study of large scale structures in
soft matter systems, chemistry, biology, solid state physics and materials science.

This model allows to specify the collimation length, i.e. the free path between
the end of the guide and the sample location. When Lc=1.5 m, the intensity is
maximal, but Q-resolution (divergence) is degraded. The Lc=40.5 m configuration
is the low-Q one.
The collimation can also be given as predefined configuration 'iLc' starting from 0

iLc ={ 1.5, 2.5, 4, 5.5, 8, 10.5, 13.5, 16.5, 20.5, 28, 34, 40.5}

so that e.g. iLc=5 corresponds with a 10.5 m collimation

The quality of the collimation section can be specified among a set of glass
pre-set specifications. The available configurations are:

| Borkron_1972   Borkron_2003    Borofloat_2001  Borofloat_2003
Chamfers [mm] | 0.2            0.2             0.8             0.2
Wavyness [rad]| 2.5e-5         1e-4            8e-4            2e-4
```
