## Description

```text
The H53 (120 x 60 mm2) curved cold guide feeds D16 (after IN14, and IN16).
D16 is a two-circle diffractometer. The primary white beam is reflected by a
focussing pyrolytic graphite monochromator (122 x 60 mm2 with mosaicity 0.7
deg) providing an important flux at the sample. The monochromator housing has
two beam holes at take-off angles of 90 deg and 115 deg, corresponding to 4.7
Angs and 5.6 Angs beams and incorporates the slit systems.
