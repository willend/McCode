# The `ILL_H5_new` Instrument

*McStas: The full H5 new cold guide at the ILL, with ThALES, D16, Super-Adam, IN15
(sample only), D22WASP and CryoEDM
This is a proposed geometry for major H5 guide hall upgrade (since 2013).
The exact adopted H5 geometry may be actually different.*

## Identification

- **Site:** ILL
- **Author:** FARHI Emmanuel (farhi@ill.fr)
- **Origin:** ILL
- **Date:** May, 2011

## Description

```text
This model decribes the full new H5 cold guide at the ILL, with ThALES, WASP, D16,
Super-Adam, IN15, D22.

H511:The IN15 Spin-echo spectrometer
is simulated with an incoming polarized beam, but not with a full spin-echo
description. Sample is Vanadium
H512:The D22 Large dynamic range small-angle diffractometer
is fully simulated
H521:The D16 Small momentum transfer diffractometer D16 is realistic
H521:The SuperADAM reflectometer is used in low angle diffraction mode.
H522: The WASP Spin-echo spectrometer
is simulated with an incoming polarized beam, but not with a full spin-echo
description. Sample is Vanadium
H523:The CryoEDM with its polarized beam
H53: The ThALES Cold neutron three-axis spectrometer IN14

For each instrument, a sample can be specified (liquid/powder/amorphous),
with monitoring of the scattering in angular (diffraction) and energy modes
(for spectroscopy).
