# The `ILL_IN5_Spots` Instrument

*McStas: The IN5B instrument: chopper system + sample + PSD and tof detector, with special resolution options.
In this version equipped with the Spot_sample from SNS, useful for resolution considerations.*

## Description

```text
The IN5@ILL TOF spectrometer from chopper system to final detector, with sample.
The detector model includes Fe housing and tube cross talk absorbing masks
with angle restriction (neutrons that scatter in Fe in front of a tube and
enter a different tube are absorbed). This model does not include the H16 guide.
```
