ESCRIPTION
SALSA is a instrument developed mainly for measuring residual stress
in a gauge volume defined by its collimators.
The instrument has three possible collimator positions, with three available collimators at each position.
This allows the gauge volumed to be defined in height, width and depth.
The size of the gauge volume is chosen in the collimator parameters. The following values correspond to sizes
in a dictionary format.
The vertical collimator {0: 2mm, 1: 4mm, 2: 10mm}
The horizontal collimator {0: 0.6mm, 1: 2mm, 2: 4mm}
The depth collimator {0: 0.6mm, 1: 2mm, 2: 4mm}

The instument showcases the Monochromator_bent component,
and the focusing use of the Collimator_radial component.

Some of the monitors used in this instrument are not actually present in the real instrument.
The only detector that is actually there, is the final monitor.
Furthermore the sample environment is of course variable depending on the sample
in question.
