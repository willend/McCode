## Description

```text
IN8 is installed on beamtube H10 (diameter F = 200 mm).

IN1 works in a time-sharing mode. This means that the same monochromator is
also used by the Be-filter spectrometer IN1-BeF and by the liquids
diffractometer D4. Changing over between the three different instruments can be
done without difficulty in about two hours.

The monochromator unit carries three different vertically focussing
monochromators built from copper single crystals (available reflecting planes
Cu(200), Cu(220) and Cu(331)). The exchange of the monochromator planes is
controlled by the instrument computer. The radius of curvature can be
automatically adjusted as function of reflected energy in order to maintain
maximal flux at the sample position in the course of energy scans. The
scattering angles on the monochromator cover a range of 10<2theta_m <90
allowing for scanning neutron energies from 13 meV to more than 1 eV..

The IN1-TAS spectrometer: the scattering angles at the sample and the analyser
can be changed in the intervals -115<2theta_S<115 and -120<2theta_S<120. Three
different analysers (PG(002), Cu(200), Cu(220)) can be installed in order to
optimise intensity and resolution for a given experiment. Various resonance
absorption filters (e.g. Er, Sm, Hf ...) can be used to suppress higher order
contaminations from the incident beam or in the scattered beam. An oriented
Pyrolytic Graphite filter is designed for experiments eventually demanding
thermal neutron energy range.

In this TAS configuration, Cu220 are used as monochromator and analyser,
with a single type detector.
