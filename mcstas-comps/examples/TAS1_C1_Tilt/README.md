# The `TAS1_C1_Tilt` Instrument

*McStas: Example formerly known as linup-2.instr

The conventional cold-source triple-axis spectrometer TAS1 at Risoe National
Laboratory used as a diffractometer for a collimator tilt alignment.*

## Identification

- **Site:** Risoe
- **Author:** A. Abrahamsen, N. B. Christensen, and E. Lauridsen
- **Origin:** Risoe
- **Date:** 1998

## Description

```text
This instrument is the conventional cold-source triple-axis spectrometer TAS1
at Risoe National Laboratory. It does not exist anymore, but was used as the
first detailed work performed with the McStas package.
Here it is used as a diffractometer for a collimator tilt alignment. The
detector is at the sample position and there is no analyzer.

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.
