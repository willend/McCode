## Identification

- **Site:** Tests_optics
- **Author:** Peter Christiansen
- **Origin:** RISOE.
- **Date:** July 2006.

## Description

```text
Very simple setup to compare intensities diffracted by Monochromators.
It shows that implementations are equivalent.

PG 002 oriented examples:

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.
