## Description

```text
Cross comparison of radial collimator components, using McStas and
contributed components. It shows that all implementations are equivalent.
The Exact_radial_coll contributed component also takes into account the absorbing
blade thickness between slits, which decreases slightly intensity.
```

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.

| Name | Unit | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
