# The `PSI_ICON` Instrument

*McStas: McStas model of the ICON imaging instrument at PSI, CH.*

## Identification

- **Site:** PSI
- **Author:** Peter Willendrup (DTU/ESS), Estrid B. Naver (DTU), based on earlier model from Ludovic Giller.
- **Origin:** DTU/ESSxs
- **Date:** June, 2021

## Description

```text
McStas model of the ICON imaging instrument at PSI, CH. Based on earlier model from Ludovic Giller, see links below.

The model was developed for an ICON beamtime focussing on exeriments using 'Propagation-based phase-contrast' aka. the Paganin-method.
The sample in the model is a series of metal sheets, each with different scattring/refracting properties. A refined version of this
instrument file was later used in the publication by Estrid B. Naver et. al., see links below.
