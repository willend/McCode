## Description

```text
McStas model of the DMC powder diffractometer at PSI, CH.

Please note that this instrument file does not include the radial collimator of DMC.
To generate the full 800-bin angle coverage at DMC, you should combine two simulations
using this instrumentfile, with SHIFT=0 and 0.1. This will displace the detector by half
a bin-width, which is a standard procedure at the DMC diffractometer
```

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.

| Name | Unit | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| lambda | AA | Choice of wavelength, affects both monochromator and source component | 2.5666 |
| R | 1 | Reflectivity of non-curved guides | 0.87 |
| R_curve | 1 | Reflectivity of curved guides | 0.87 |
| filename | str | Choice of reflection list file, e.g. from McStas data dir | "Na2Ca3Al2F14.laz" |
| D_PHI | deg | Focusing 'd_phi' for PowderN, see mcdoc page | 6 |
| SHIFT | deg | Rotation of detector, set to 0.1 to displace by half a bin | 0 |
| PACK | 1 | Powder packing factor | 0.7 |
| Dw | 1 | Powder Debye-Waller factor | 0.8 |
| BARNS | 1 | Flag to define if powder reflection file \|F2\| is in Barns or fm | 1 |
