## Description

```text
ESCRIPTION
The approximative, analytic SNS Source description of this instrument is realised
by use of the ESS_moderator_short model, but weighted due to the opposite moderator
arrangement at the SNS and at the once-planned ESS short pluse facility. The correct
SNS Source File to use with SNS_Source is source_sct091_tu_02_1.dat.

The instrument serves as a test instrument for the components
Spherical_Backscattering_Analyser, also written by by Niko Tsapatsaris with help from
Peter Willendrup and Guide_m by Niko Tsapatsaris.

The instrument is based on models initially written by
A) REL (ruep.lechner@gmail.com) and HNB (bordallo@nbi.ku.dk) with contributions
from Johan Jacobsen (johan.fett@gmail.com)
B) G. Granroth

A virtual experiment on BASIS i.e. a comparison with real and simulation results were
published in AIP conference,DOI: 10.1051/epjconf/20158303015 and RSI, DOI: 10.1063/1.4961569

Instrument geometry parameters etc. were taken from the publication:
"A time-of-flight backscattering spectrometer at the Spallation Neutron Source, BASIS" by
Mamontov, E.;   Herwig, K. W.; Neutron Scattering Science Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831, USA, in Review of Scientific Instruments,82(8),085109 - 085109-10, 2011

This simulation uses the sample component Isotropic_Sqw. We are using the description for a Vanadium
hollow cylindrical sample. One Arm Component is used to place the Analyser Component at an angle
defined as ROT1.
