# The `TAS1_Diff_Slit` Instrument

*McStas: Example formerly known as linup-3.instr

The conventional cold-source triple-axis spectrometer TAS1 at Risoe National
Laboratory used as a diffractometer for a collimation alignment study with a
slit sample.*

## Identification

- **Author:** A. Abrahamsen, N. B. Christensen, and E. Lauridsen
- **Origin:** Risoe
- **Date:** 1998

## Description

```text
This instrument is the conventional cold-source triple-axis spectrometer TAS1
at Risoe National Laboratory. It does not exist anymore, but was used as the
first detailed work performed with the McStas package.
Here it is used as a diffractometer for a collimation alignment study. The
sample is a slit and there is no analyzer.

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.
