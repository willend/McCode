# The `Demonstration` Instrument

*McStas: General demonstration of Union*

## Identification

- **Site:** Union_demos
- **Author:** Mads Bertelsen
- **Origin:** University of Copenhagen
- **Date:** September 2015

## Description

```text
Demonstration of Union components. Here four different powder samples are
placed in a can each connected to a weird sample holder and contained in
a cryostat. This unrealistic example is meant to show the syntax and the
new possibilities when using the Union components.
With the standard source only two of the samples are illuminated, yet
multiple scattering occur and events are thus taking place in the last
two samples.
```

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.

| Name | Unit | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| stick_displacement | m | height displacement of sample stick | 0 |
| transmission_picture | 1 | if 1, a transmission image of the entire cryostat is made instead of a scattering experiment | 0 |
