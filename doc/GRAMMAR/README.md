# McCode grammar documentation
This folder contains documentation for the grammar of the McCode (McStas/McXtrace)
Monte Carlo ray-tracing methods.

* See [Instrument](Instrument) for keywords relating to instrument files
* See [Component](Component) for keywords relating to component files

To keep track and decide *if*, *why* and *how* changes are are made to
the [code generator](../../mccode/src) files we rely on keeping
*Architectural Design Records* in [ADR-records](ADR-records).
