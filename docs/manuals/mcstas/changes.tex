\chapter{New features in \MCS \version\ }
\label{c:changes}

%TODO FIXME UPDATE!!!!

This version of \MCS implements both new features, as well as many bug corrections. Bugs are reported and traced using the \MCS Trac Ticket system \cite{github_issue_webpage}. We will not present here an extensive list of corrections, and we let the reader refer to this bug reporting service for details. Only important changes are indicated here.

Of course, we can not guarantee that the software is bullet proof, but we do our best to correct bugs, when they are reported.\index{Bugs!reporting}

The complete listing of changes related to the version \MCS \version
is available in CHANGES document of the relevant download folder at
