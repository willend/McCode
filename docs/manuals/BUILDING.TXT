To build a McStas or McXtrace set of manuals, follow the below recipe

* Build on Linux
* Dependencies e.g. texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-bibtex-extra
* cd mcstas
* cp -rp ../../../cmake cmake
* mkdir tmp
* cd tmp
* cmake ..
* make

The resulting pdf's are then to be added to the similar hieracy in the 
../../docpkg folder
