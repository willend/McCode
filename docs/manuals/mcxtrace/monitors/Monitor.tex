\section{Monitor: Simple intensity monitor}

The \textbf{Monitor} component is a simple photon counter that merely detects the integrated
intensity in an aperture \textit{xwidth} by \textit{yheight} \si{\metre\squared}. It does \emph{not} write
a separate datafile, but reports the $I, I_err, N$-signals to the console. The signals represent
 intensity, error estimate, and number of statistical events (photon rays). If a scan is performed, the intensity recorded by \textbf{Monitor}
will be written to the scan datafile.
