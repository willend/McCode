## Description

```text
This is model of the DIFFABS beam-line at synchrotron SOLEIL, combining diffraction and absorption.

The range of instrumental techniques that can be used on this line concerns
numerous sectors of fundamental research and finalized applied research (oil
industry, nuclear field , metallurgy) among which the science of materials and
chemistry hold a predominant position. In particular, in situ studies of the
transformations in materials at ultra-high temperature will be the domain of
excellence of this line. The interest of coupled absorption, or coupled -
diffraction measurements on powders or monocristalssingle crystals, is to ensure
that both experiments are carried out on the same zone of the sample, in
absolutely identical physico-chemical conditions (temperature, pressure,
reactive atmosphere around the sample), which is very important for establishing
correlations between the information provided by both types of measurements in
the case of complex materials or materials under extreme conditions.

Position | Element
---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
0        | the BM D13-1 Bender B=1.71 T in range 3-23 keV, e-beam cross-section 55.1x20.6 µm2 123.7x1.6 µrad. Other specs give 60.1x24.9 µm and 134.8x2.1 µrad. Critical energy 8.6 keV.
11.85    | primary slit
14.92    | M1 bent mirror with Rh/Si coating. Focuses vertically the beam on the DCM. length 1300 mm, width 100 mm. 2.4 mrad incidence above 19 keV, 3 mrad in 12.5-19 keV, and 5 mrad in 6.5-12.5 keV, and 6 mrad below.
17.462   | a Si(111) DCM. First crystal is 200x100 mm flat at 2.54 m from M1; 2nd is bent 70x100 mm to focus the beam horizontally.
19.28    | M2 bent mirror with Rh coating, 1300x100 mm. Focuses vertically the beam. At 1.817 from DCM.
