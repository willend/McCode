## Description

```text
The beamline ANATOMIX (Advanced Nanotomography and Imaging with coherent X rays)
works at photon energies between 5 and 50 keV. It is dedicated to full-field
radiography and tomography in absorption and phase contrast, with pixel sizes
from 20 nm to 20 µm.

ANATOMIX is a beamline for X-ray tomography on the micro- and nanoscale, in
absorption and phase contrast. It operates in the energy range from 5 keV upward
and allows its users to obtain two- and three-dimensional radiographic images of
bulk volume samples of macroscopic size (up to several cm thickness). For
smaller samples, a spatial resolution down to 50 nm (20 nm pixel size) can be
achieved. Real-time studies are possible at speeds of currently up to one
microtomography scan per second; higher speeds up to 20 volume scans per second
(50 ms per scan) have been demonstrated.

A flexible sample interface enables in situ and/or operando studies under
conditions similar to the natural or working environment of the samples
(temperature, humidity, mechanical load, transport processes). Biological
samples can be measured without dehydration and, in many cases, without chemical
fixation. With suitable sample preparation, cellular imaging without cryogenic
environment is possible.

This is a simplified model with an Undulator, a double channel-cut monochromator,
a sample stage and a detector. It models a parallel beam full field tomograph.
The monochromator is an Si(111), the sample is made of Ge. The sample is 2 cm
wide.

List of important beamline elements. Distances are given from the center of the undulator.
