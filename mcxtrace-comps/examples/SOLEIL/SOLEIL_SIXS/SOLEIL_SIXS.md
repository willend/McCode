## Description

```text
SixS (Surface Interface X-ray Scattering) is a beamline dedicated to the study
of X-ray scattering from surfaces and interfaces of hard and soft matter in
various environments in the 5-20 keV energy range. To be sensitive to the
surface all the studies are performed in grazing-incidence geometry. The
beamline is equipped with two experimental hutches, which ae dedicated to the
study of surfaces, interfaces and nano-objets prepared:

- in-situ under UHV (Ultra High Vacuum, i.e. 10-10 mbar) conditions. A
diffractometer allows to measure X-ray scattering from samples under UHV;
- in various environments (catalysis chambers, soft matter, electrochemical
cells). A diffractometer coupled with exchangeable chambers will be able to
measure X-ray scattering from sample surfaces both in vertical or horizontal
geometries.

Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD), Grazing Incidence Small Angle
X-ray Scattering (GISAXS), anomalous surface X-ray scattering, X-Ray
Reflectivity (XRR), magnetic surface X-ray scattering and coherent scattering
experiments are performed on both the facilities.

In this implementation, the multipurpose diffractometer is used, with a thin
single crystal layer on top of a Si bulk.
