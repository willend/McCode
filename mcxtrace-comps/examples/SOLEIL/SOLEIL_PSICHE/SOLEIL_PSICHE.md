# The `SOLEIL_PSICHE` Instrument

*McXtrace: A simple model of the PSICHE tomography/diffraction beam-line at Synchrotron SOLEIL.*

## Identification

## Description

```text
The PSICHÉ beamline is installed on a short straight section of the SOLEIL
(I03c), The source is a under vacuum multi-pole wiggler (2.1 T) which delivers
a white beam with a large photon energy range (15-100+ keV).
To perform the various experiments performed on the beamline, 4 different
operating modes are available.

This model allows the white beam mode for energy dispersive x-ray diffraction,
and the monochromatic beam tomography.

The sample handles absorption, with edge contrast, as well as fluorescence.

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.

| Name | Unit | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| E0 | keV | Nominal energy at the Wiggler. Sets the monochromator angle when DCM_present | 31 |
| dE | keV | Energy half-bandwidth at the Wiggler | 1 |
| DCM_present | 1 | Allow the monochromator in place (1) or removed (0, white beam) | 0 |
| sample_theta | deg | Rotation of the sample stage | 0 |
| sample_material | str | Absorption data file for the sample | "Ag" |
| sample_geometry | str | OFF/PLY file name for sample 3D geometry, or emty for a box | "wire.ply" |
| dcm_theta | deg | Rotation angle of the DCM. 0=set from energy E0 | 0 |
