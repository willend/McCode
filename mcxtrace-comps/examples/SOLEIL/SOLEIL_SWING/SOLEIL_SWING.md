# The `SOLEIL_SWING` Instrument

*McXtrace: A simple model for the SWING beam-line at SOLEIL (small angle scattering, SAXS).*

## Identification

## Description

```text
The SWING beamline targets soft condensed matter, conformation of
macro-molecules in solution (BioSAXS) and material sciences. Our experimental
set up allows simultaneous small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle
X-ray scattering measurements (WAXS) in the 5-16 keV energy range. Anomalous
scattering experiments can also be performed. A very large variety of types of
samples can be studied, e.g., solutions, gels, amorphous solids, crystallized
solids, thanks to the diversity of the proposed sample environments.

This model may use any PDB file as sample, or an ideal sphere colloid for testing.
