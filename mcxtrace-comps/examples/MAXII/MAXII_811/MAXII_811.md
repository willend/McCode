# The `MAXII_811` Instrument

*McXtrace: XAFS and surface diffraction, Materials Science Beamline 811 at MAX-lab.*

## Identification

- **Site:** MAXII
- **Author:** Erik B Knudsen (erkn@fysik.dtu.dk)
- **Origin:** DTU Physics
- **Date:** Jan 23, 2011

## Description

```text
Fed by a wiggler, this beamline operates in monochromatic mode with an
operational energy tunable between 2.3 – 20 keV (0.6 - 5.3 AA).
The wavelength is chosen by a double monochromator crystal setup where either
Si 111 or Si 311 may be chosen. Furthermore a double mirror
setup may be used to to focus the beam onto a sample. The rotation of the
first mirror defines the position of the second which is computed automatically.
If mirrors are in the monochromators are automatically reposistioned to
accomadate the deflected beam.
