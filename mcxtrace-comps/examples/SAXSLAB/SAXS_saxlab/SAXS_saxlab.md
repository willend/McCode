## Description

```text
The small-angle scattering (SAXS) instrument generally consists of the following parts:
the X-ray source ( the system includes rotating copper anode and KB multilayermirrors),
a pinhole collimation system and a detector.

The geometry of this instument is such that an x-ray source (turned 45 deg.) shines light
on Montel mirror pair. The mirror pair is mounted such that the doubly reflected radiation
is deflected downwards (negative y-axis). This means the the mirror join is pointing upwards, and th
mirrors themselves extending +-45 degrees downwards.
There are slits attached to the mirror exits
This arrangement is designed to closesly resemble the SAXSlab system installed at
NBI (University of Copenhagen)

The evolution of the beam is tracked using a series of 2D PSD monitors situated along the beam axis,
which points slightly down.
In real life the beam axis is parallel to the ground and the source is shining slightly upwards.
