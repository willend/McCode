## Description

```text
This is a proof of concept beamline to test an idea of how to build a low-cost
monochromtic beamline. Idea is to let a polychromatic beam impinge on a focusing
Be-lens and put a slit in the focal pt. of the lens for the desired wavelength. Any
other wavelengths present in the beam will not be focussed prefectly and may be
by the slit.

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.

| Name | Unit | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| L1 | m | Distance between source and lens | 10 |
| L2 | m | Distance between lens and and slit | 1 |
| dS | m | Slit opening. Slit opening is quadratic. | 1e-2 |
| N | 1 | NUmber of Lenses in the compund lens arrangement | 1 |
