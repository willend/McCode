## Description

```text
Toy model used for testing various sample components for solution-SAXS.

The following SAXS samples are handled:
SAXSSpheres               SAMPLE=0
SAXSShells                SAMPLE=1
SAXSCylinders             SAMPLE=2
SAXSEllipticCylinders     SAMPLE=3
SAXSLiposomes             SAMPLE=4
SAXSNanodiscs             SAMPLE=5
SAXSNanodiscsWithTags     SAMPLE=6
SAXSPDB                   SAMPLE=7 (very slow, rather use SAXSPDBFast)
SAXSCurve                 SAMPLE=8 (inactivated)
SAXSNanodiscsFast         SAMPLE=9
SAXSNanodiscsWithTagsFast SAMPLE=10
SAXSPDBFast               SAMPLE=11
```

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.
