# The `ESRF_BM29` Instrument

*McXtrace: A simple BM29 model at ESRF.*

## Identification

- **Site:** ESRF
- **Author:** Martin Cramer Pedersen (mcpe@nbi.dk)
- **Origin:** KU-Science
- **Date:** October 28th, 2021

## Description

```text
Toy model used for testing various sample components for solution-SAXS
mimicking the geometry of the BM29 beamline at ESRF:
https://www.esrf.fr/home/UsersAndScience/Experiments/MX/About_our_beamlines/bm29/beamline-specifications.html

Note that this model does not include much of the beamline optics, instead it emulates their effect
by settgin relevant beam parameters from a model source.

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.
