## Description

```text
A model of the ATHENA-telescope using just a single shell as optical element.
That means to make use of this instrument
it is necessary to run a series of simulation while varying the input parameter shellnumber.

The model needs as input a file geomfile, which contains (in ascii) tabled details about the geometry of the shells.
The data in the geomfile is assumed to be in the format:
#row  L/m  rad_h/m  rad_m/m  rad_p/m  width/m
...
row: running index for the rows/rings
L: The length of the plates for this ring
rad_h: The radius at the "hyperbolic" end of the optic. At the detector end.
rad_m: The radius at the midpoint of the optic. This is the reference.
rad_p: The radius at the "parabolic" and of the optic. At the source end.

Example: ATHENA_1sh_both.instr shellnumber=1
```

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.

| Name | Unit | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| FL | m | The focal length of the optical system | 12 |
| optics_dist | m | The distance between souce and optic. In space this would be quite large :-). | 10 |
| XWidth | m | The width of the user detector default is that of the ATHENA WFI large area detector | 0.13312 |
| YHeight | m | The height of the user detector default is that of the ATHENA WFI large area detector | 0.13312 |
| NX |  | Number of pixels along X in the user detector | 1024 |
| NY |  | Number of pixels along Y in the user detector. | 1024 |
| reflectivity |  | Data file containing reflectivities (such as from IMD) | "mirror_coating_unity.txt" |
| E0 | keV | Central energy of X-rays | 5 |
| dE | keV | Half spread of energy spectrum to be emitted from source | 0.001 |
| shellnumber |  | The row number for the miror module. This defines the shell. | 1 |
| geomfile |  | File which contains the geometry of the pores (i.e. radii,lengths) | "ATHENA_rings_1_20.dat" |
| primParab |  |  | 1 |
| secHyper |  |  | 1 |
