## Description

```text
A model of the ATHENA-telescope using just a single mirror module as optical element. That means to make use of this instrument
it is necessary to run a series of simulation while varying the input parameter porenumber.
At present, the porenumber really means mirror module number.

The model needs as input a set of files: A Mirror Module definition file and a ring definition file.
The former contains overall definitions of mirror modules and their positions - the latter contains details about each plate.
There is some redundancy between the two files. The latter will be rendered unnecessary in a later version.
An example of mmdef_file is "MM_Definitions-cfgA.csv" which is distributed by ESA.
An example of ringfile is "ref_design.dat" which is taken from the ATHENA_reference design white-paper.

Reflectivity may be modelled using a datafile. In this telscope model only the top (intentionally reflecting) surface
is given a data-file. However, the MM-components can cope with non-zero reflectivity for side-walls and bottom surfaces.
The reflectivity datafile follows a simple ascii-format with 6 header lines the define the ranges in energy E and grazing
angle theta, followed by a 2D-data block with reflectivity numbers. This is expected to be substituted for a 1D-parametrization '
in q, to avoid overly lagre data-files.

Example: ATHENA_cfgA_1mm.instr porenumber=3
