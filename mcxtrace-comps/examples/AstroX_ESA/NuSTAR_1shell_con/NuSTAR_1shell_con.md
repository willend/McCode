## Description

```text
A model of the NuSTAR-telescope using just a single shell as optical element.
That means to make use of this instrument
it is necessary to run a series of simulation while varying the input parameter shellnumber.

The model needs as input a file geomfile, which contains (in ascii) tabled details about the geometry of the shells.
The data in the geomfile is assumed to be in the format:
#row  L/m  rad_h/m  rad_m/m  rad_p/m  width/m
...
row: running index for the rows/rings
L: The length of the plates for this ring
rad_h: The radius at the "hyperbolic" end of the optic. At the detector end.
rad_m: The radius at the midpoint of the optic. This is the reference.
rad_p: The radius at the "parabolic" and of the optic. At the source end.
width: pore width ?

Example: NuSTAR_1shell_con.instr shellnumber=1
```

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.
