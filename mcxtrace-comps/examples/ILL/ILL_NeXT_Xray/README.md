## Description

```text
DRAFT model of the X-ray imaging option of NeXT-Grenoble at the ILL.

Hardware (Tengattini et al., NIM A 968 (2020) 163939):
- source:   Hamamatsu L12161-07 sealed microfocus tube, W target, Be window,
up to 150 kV / 500 uA, minimum focal spot 5 um, 43 deg cone
- detector: Varex PaxScan 2530HE flat panel, CsI scintillator,
1792 x 2176 pixels of 139 um (portrait), up to 9 Hz (33 Hz bin 2)
- source-detector distance: >= 500 mm (set by the 43 deg cone covering the
~25 x 30 cm panel), four source positions 20 mm apart
-> SDD = 0.50, 0.52, 0.54, 0.56 m
- the sample sits on the common (neutron) rotation axis; the source-object
distance SOD sets the magnification M = SDD/SOD. The quoted 5 um
resolution needs M ~ 28, i.e. SOD ~ 18-20 mm.
- the ILL web page (2026) quotes a 20-300 kV source, i.e. the tube may have
been upgraded; kV > 150 is allowed here but flagged.

Geometry: the X-ray axis is the McXtrace z axis. At NeXT it is horizontal and
perpendicular to the neutron beam (neutrons travel along -x or +x here, depending
on the side of the source); the source/detector pivot (+-20 deg) is not modelled.

The sample defaults to the same object as in ILL_H521_NeXT: a vertical Fe rod,
radius 5 mm, for direct bimodal comparison (the neutron model gives T~0.4 at the
rod centre in white beam). An inner inclusion (e.g. an H2O-filled bore) can be added.

Detector: two ideal pixelated monitors on the flat-panel plane
Xray_counts:  photon counts (photon-counting response)
Xray_energy:  energy-weighted intensity [keV/s per pixel], a first-order model
of the energy-integrating CsI flat panel.
NOT modelled: CsI absorption efficiency vs energy, scintillator/optical blur,
focal-spot growth with tube power, heel effect, scatter from the sample
environment, and the 6 mm Pb / 10 mm + 5 mm B4C neutron shielding of the panel
(5 mm B4C over the active area transmits roughly 80-90 % at 40-150 keV).

ASSUMPTIONS (to be checked):
- Be exit window 0.2 mm (the L12161-07 datasheet value should be checked)
- focal spot = electron-beam footprint on the anode (square, focal_spot)
- anode take-off angle 12 deg (reflection-type microfocus tube, typical)
- Source_lab is a thick-target Kramers model; absolute intensity is indicative
```

## Examples

- **Test: kV=150 SOD=0.1 SDD=0.5 Detector: Xray_counts_I=1e9**
