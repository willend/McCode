# The `SAXSNanodiscsWithTagsFast` Component

*McXtrace: Release: McXtrace 1.0

A sample of monodisperse phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs in solution (water) - with
histidine tag still on the belt proteins.*

## Identification

- **Author:** Martin Cramer Pedersen (mcpe@nbi.dk)
- **Origin:** KU-Science
- **Date:** May 2, 2012

## Description

```text
A component very similar to SAXSNanodiscsWithTags.comp - however, the
scattering profile is only computed once, and linear interpolation is then used
to simulate the instrument.

Example: SAXSNanodiscsWithTagsFast( xwidth = 0.01, yheight = 0.01, zdepth = 0.01, SampleToDetectorDistance = 0.48, DetectorRadius = 0.1 )
```
