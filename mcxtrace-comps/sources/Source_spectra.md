# The `Source_spectra` Component

*McXtrace: Release: McXtrace 1.5

Specialized X-ray source for reading in SPECTRA 10 source definitions*

## Identification

## Description

```text
This is a source component for connecting SPECTRA 10-output files with McXtrace.
json-style SPECTRA 11 output files are not yet supported.

SPECTRA is an application software to calculate optical properties of synchrotron
radiation (SR) emitted from bending magnets, wigglers (conventional and elliptical)
and undulators (conventional, helical, elliptical and figure-8). Calculations
of radiation from an arbitrary magnetic field distribution are also available.
Parameters on the electron beam and the source can be edited completely on
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and it is possible to show the calculation
result graphically. The energy spectrum and radiation power after transmitting
various filters and convolution of detector's resolution are also available.
See <a href="http://spectrax.org/spectra/">SPECTRA</a>.

If the source is symmetric in x and/or y it is possible to speed up the spectra
calculations by only including one half-plane or quadrant. The other side/quadrants will then
be mirrored by McXtrace.

%BUGS
Absolute intensity of 4D (x,y,x',y') is nor correctly normalized.

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.

| Name | Unit | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| spectra_stem_x | str | Filename stem of x-projection of source distribution. -n.xxx will be added where n is a serial number and xxx spectra_suffix. | "" |
| spectra_stem_y | str | Filename stem of y-projection of source distribution. -n.xxx will be added where n is a serial number and xxx spectra_suffix. | "" |
| spectra_stem | str | Filename stem of x,x',y,y'-source distribution distribution. -n.xxx will be added where n is a serial number and xxx spectra_suffix. | "" |
| spectra_suffix | str | Suffix of spectra output files. | "dsc" |
| E0 | keV | Mean energy of X-rays. | 0 |
| dE | keV | Energy spread of X-rays. | 0 |
| **Emin** | keV | Energy of low end of the Spectra-calculated data. |  |
| **Emax** | keV | Energy of high end of the Spectra-calculated data. |  |
| **nE** | int | Number of steps in the spectra-calculations. |  |
| randomphase | 0/1 | If !=0 the photon phase is chosen randomly. | 1 |
| phase | rad | Value of the photon phase (only used if randomphase==0). | 0 |
| nx | int | Number of grid points along x in datafiles. If zero this is computed from the files. | 0 |
| ny | int | Number of grid points along y in datafiles. If zero this is computed from the files. | 0 |
| npx | int | Number of grid points along x' in datafiles. If zero this is computed from the files. | 0 |
| npy | int | Number of grid points along y' in datafiles. If zero this is computed from the files. | 0 |
| initial_serial | int | First serial number of the series of spectra files. | 1 |
| symmetricx | 0/1 | If nonzero the source is mirrored in the x-axis. This to allow smaller spectra-calculations. | 0 |
| symmetricy | 0/1 | If nonzero the source is mirrored in the y-axis. This to allow smaller spectra-calculations. | 0 |
| verbose | 0/1 | If non-zero output more warning messages. | 0 |
| flag4d | 0/1 | Use either (0) x,y-projections or (1) full 4D x,y,x',y' datafiles. | 0 |
| noinit | 0/1 | Do no initialize the component. Can be usefiul in conjunction with a deactivating WHEN-clause. | 0 |
