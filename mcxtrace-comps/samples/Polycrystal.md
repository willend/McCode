*McXtrace: Release: McXtrace 1.0

Polycrystal made from single crystal-like voxels*

## Description

```text
The component creates a threedimensional grid of cubic instances of the Single_crystal-component,through
which the rays are propagated. The component relies on a list of possible orientations and stretches of the
initial unit cell and a list correlating each voxel of the polycrystal to an entry in the list of rotations
and stretches.

Example: Polycrystal( MapFile= "polycrystal_1layer_2orts.map", OrientationsFile= "stretch_2orts.orts",
ReflectionsDatafile= "GeReduced.lau", xwidth= 200e-6, yheight= 200e-6, zdepth = 50e-6,
DeltadOverd = 0.001, Mosaicity = 1, SigmaAbsorbtion  = 0.0, SigmaIncoherent = 0.0,
MaxNumberOfReflections    = 1, ProbabilityOfTransmission = 0.5,
ax = 5.6579, ay = 0.0000, az = 0.0000, bx = 0.0000, by = 5.6579, bz = 0.0000, cx = 0.0000, cy = 0.0000, cz = 5.6579 )
```

## Input parameters

Parameters in **boldface** are required; the others are optional.

| Name | Unit | Description | Default |
|------|------|-------------|---------|
| MapFile | str | File describing, which orientation is found in which voxel | "" |
| OrientationsFile | str | File describing the different orientations | "" |
| ReflectionsDatafile | str | File describing the reflections in the relevant lattice (usually in .lau-format) | "Si.lau" |
| MaterialDatafile | str | File describing the scattering and absorbtion properties of the material | "Si.txt" |
| xwidth | m | Width of the sample | 0.0 |
| yheight | m | Height of the sample | 0.0 |
| zdepth | m | Depth of the sample | 0.0 |
| ax | AA | x-coordinate of the first internal unit cell vector in the sample | 5.43 |
| ay | AA | y-coordinate of the first internal unit cell vector in the sample | 0.00 |
| az | AA | z-coordinate of the first internal unit cell vector in the sample | 0.00 |
| bx | AA | x-coordinate of the second internal unit cell vector in the sample | 0.00 |
| by | AA | y-coordinate of the second internal unit cell vector in the sample | 5.43 |
| bz | AA | z-coordinate of the second internal unit cell vector in the sample | 0.00 |
| cx | AA | x-coordinate of the third internal unit cell vector in the sample | 0.00 |
| cy | AA | y-coordinate of the third internal unit cell vector in the sample | 0.00 |
| cz | AA | z-coordinate of the third internal unit cell vector in the sample | 5.43 |
| Mosaicity | moa | Gaussian mosaicity | 3.0 |
| MosaicityA | moa | Anisotropic mosaicity around the first unit cell vector | 0.0 |
| MosaicityB | moa | Anisotropic mosaicity around the second unit cell vector | 0.0 |
| MosaicityC | moa | Anisotropic mosaicity around the third unit cell vector | 0.0 |
| DeltadOverd | 1 | Statistical description of the lattice spacing | 0.01 |
| ProbabilityOfTransmission | 0-1 | Probability that a ray will not interact with the sample | 0.01 |
| SigmaAbsorbtion | fm^2 | Absorbtion crosssection of the sample | 0.0 |
| SigmaIncoherent | fm^2 | Incoherent crosssection of the sample | 0.0 |
| MaxNumberOfReflections | 1 | Highest number of allowed scattering events in the entire crystal - to prevent computationally expensive high-order multiple scattering. If this parameter is set to 0, all possible orders of scattering are considered. | 1 |
| Reciprocal | 0/1 | If this parameter is set to 0, then the lattice vectors should be given in real space. Anything else implies that the vectors are given in reciprocal space. | 0 |
| verbose | 0/1 | If nonzero - output more info to the console. | 0 |
